Follow up reading to the lecture on data types:

- Although Bolstad's chapter is a nice generic review, it is actually more helpful to talk specifically about the data formats that ESRI uses. Read through the following pages:

- - [How a GIS represents and models geographic information](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/How_a_GIS_represents_and_models_geographic_information/00v20000000w000000/)
  - [Three fundamental representations of geographic information layers](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00v200000010000000.htm)
  - [About Geographic Data Formats](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/About_geographic_data_formats/00r90000006r000000/)

- If you want more background, skim very briefly the following from Chapter Two (Data Models) of [Bolstad (2005)]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/text-readings) 

  - pp 25-30 in detail (especially part on coordinate data)
  - skim page 31 on Attribute Data
  - skim pp 32-42 on Vector Data
  - skim pp 42-46 on Raster Data
  - skip pp 47-60 (or very quickly flip through)
  - pp 61-62 in detail starting with 'Common File Formats'
