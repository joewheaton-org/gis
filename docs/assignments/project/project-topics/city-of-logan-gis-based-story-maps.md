title: City of Logan, GIS-Based Story Maps
---

**Tasks: **(Note: This initiative could involve several different classes or the same class over multiple semesters)

Using Logan Cityâ€™s existing GIS maps, create overlay [story maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/) that provide descriptive information about the City. Examples include:

- City building information (e.g., where to go for specific services)
- Trails information
- Parks information
- Golf course information (e.g., visual representation of each hole)
- Local points of interest information, including hotels and restaurants

We will use ESRI's [new Story Maps platform](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/articles/what-is-a-story-map/) to package your story and present it, and you can 'publish' your story and use one of [ESRI's publications](http://www.esri.com/esri-news/publications) (e.g. ArcNews, ArcUser, ArcWatch) as your target journal for the manuscript requirement of the project. 

**Benefits to Logan City: **Easily-accessible, interactive, professional-looking information about Logan City
