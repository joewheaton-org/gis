title: Project Topics
---

You can choose any research problem or applied problem as a project topic that to address requires you to do spatial analysis and put the skills you developed in WATS 4930/6920 to task. Most graduate students choose a topic related to their own research, but some use this assignment as an excuse to tackle something specifically not part of their research. Undergraduates sometimes have their own ideas for projects they bring to the table and pursue, but often choose from a list of 'canned topics' that evolves each year. Any student is welcome to propose their own topic or choose from options below, in which we pair you up with an adviser who helps you.

This year's 'canned' topics include (list will grow):

- [Prioritizing eroding bluffs for stabilization, Minnesota River Basin](http://etal.usu.edu/Courses/GIS/2015/Projects/GIS%20Project_BluffStabilization.pdf) - Peter Wilcock promises lots of personal attention in helping you with this project.
