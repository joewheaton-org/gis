title: Poster Session
---

We will hold a poster session during class on April 23rd in the Atrium. You will each prepare your own poster to present during your normal lab time.

- The poster should be a summary of the key findings from your work and your interpretations. You will unlikely be able to fit everything you did on one poster.
- The poster should briefly tell a story and present the question/motivation, objectives, study site, methods, results, interpretation, conclusion.
- Attendance is mandatory to get a passing grade on the [project]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/project).

### Poster Format

You should prepare a full-size poster (e.g. 24" or 36" tall  by 48" wide) and print a hard copy to hang in one of the following formats: 

- A sequence of six to ten 8.5 x 11 tiled sheets that comprise the whole poster.
- A full size poster (you can print these at the [US Government Document section](http://library.usu.edu/govdocs/topo.php) in the bottom of the Merrill - Cazier library, the [copy center](http://www.usu.edu/pdp/?M=63), or [RSGIS Lab](http://www.gis.usu.edu/printing.html) for a fee)

Even if you do not print a full size version of your poster, it is recommended that you prepare the posters in something like Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Publisher or Microsoft PowerPoint on a full size poster sheet (see [here](http://web.pdx.edu/~clarksk/poster.html) if you need help). You should prepare a PDF or image of your poster, so you can host a digital copy on your project page for your website.  

- Highlight the authors' names, e-mails, and address information in case the viewer is interested in contacting you for more information.
- Prepare all diagrams or charts neatly and legibly beforehand in a size sufficient to be read at a distance of 2 meters. Paragraph and figure caption text should be AT LEAST 24-point font (0.9 cm height) and headers AT LEAST 36 point font (1.2 cm height). Use creativity by using different font sizes and styles, perhaps even color.
- Use different colors and textures/symbols for each line or bar contained in your graph or chart. A serif font (e.g., Times) is often easier for reading main text, and a non-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica) for headers and figure labels.
- Organize the paper on the poster board so it is clear, orderly, and self-explanatory. You have complete freedom in displaying your information in figures, tables, text, photographs, etc.
- Use squares, rectangles, circles, etc., to group similar ideas. Avoid cluttering your poster with too much text. Label different elements as I, II, III; or 1, 2, 3; or A, B, C, making it easier for a viewer to follow your display.
- Include the background of your research followed by results and conclusions. A successful poster presentation depends on how well you convey information to an interested audience.

Also post a PDF (< 10 MB in size) on your project pages for your course website, and submit the URL to Canvas to receive poster credit.

If you want to use our `PowerPoint Poster_Template.ppt`, you are welcome to. Feel free to change look and layout entirely from this:

### Session Format

We will split the class into two  groups. Groups will alternate between standing by their posters and answering questions and wandering between the different posters. You will be responsible for filling out anonymous peer-review forms of others' posters and you will be encouraged to give each other constructive critiques and helpful feedback. You will be graded in part on your participation in this peer-review process.
