title: Lab 08 - GIS Modelling Choice
---

In Lab 8, you get to decide which lab you'd like to do.  If you're loving the DEM analysis stuff, you can do a [Morphometric Analysis Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/labs/lab-8---choice/lab08a), which digs into [GIS Modelling]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/week-8-gis-modeling) and geoprocessing you can do with DEMs to do meaningful analysis. If you've had enough of DEMs, or are motivated more by biological applications of GIS, you can do a [Habitat Modelling Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/labs/lab-8---choice/lab-08B---habitat-modeling). 

If you want to a) be an overachiever, and/or b) just earn some extra credit to boost your grade, you can do both labs. We will count your highest score between the two labs toward your grade and the other will be straight extra-credit.
