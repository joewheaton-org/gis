title: Task 3 - Publish Maps to Lab Page
---

### Prepare Your Website

- Bring up your Google Site for this class and log in (if you are not already) so you can edit it. Mine is <https://sites.google.com/site/gisdummyclass/>.
- Navigate to your Lab 01 page you created in [Task 2](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/task-2---build-website).
- Start editing your Lab 01 page and organize it to present the work you did in [Task 1](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/task-1---build-map). If you want some tips, watch this video:

### Insert and Display Your Image and link to PDF of Map

- You will use the *Insert -> Image* command to insert and display the jpg image of the map you produced in [Task 01](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/task-1---build-map). 
- You will use the *attachment *feature at the bottom of your page to attach the PDF your produced in [Task 01](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/task-1---build-map) to this page and then you will copy its URL and use it with the *Link *command to make it downloadable from further up your page (within the body of the page, below the map image). 
- If you would like some pointers with either of these steps, watch this video:

### Make & Upload Your Interactive Map

Making an interactive map is very straightforward.

**Making an Interactive Google Map**

- Search for and go to "Google My Maps"  
- Log in if needed
- In the upper left click +Create New Map
- Under "Untitled Layer" Click the "import" hyperlink
- Choose to Select a File from your Computer
- Navigate to and select your study site KMZ file.
- If the map doesn't pan and zoom to Tony Grove, navigate to the correct location and verify the proper display of your polygons.
- Then notice back on the Google My Maps page that the map and layer are untitled - Give them titles. This is how the interactive map will be labeled on your website, so consider meaningful, purposeful, titles (not "lab 1 map").
- Notice too that you can choose a different basemap (in Google My Maps)
- IMPORTANT: Use the Share button (google) to allow the public to view the map, otherwise it will not display on your webpage.
- Press the 3 buttons to the right of the Map's title in Google My Maps and choose "embed on my site"
- Copy the HTML code
- On your website, turn on the HTML view and scroll to the location on the page you want the map to appear > paste the html code.
- That's it.

### Polish up Your Website

- Mine (<https://sites.google.com/site/gisdummyclass/>) is rubbish. Take a few minutes and clean up your website so that it conforms nicely to the [six C's](http://gis.joewheaton.org/about/grades#TOC-The-Six-C-s-Rubric). 
- Make sure you provide plenty of context text to explain your lab clearly to someone who might stumble across your webpage and have no idea what it is for. 
- Copy the URL of your website and submit on the Canvas Assignment 1 page.
- NOTE: your Google Site must be publicly available or we won't be able to view your site.

Check [here](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01#TOC-What-to-Submit) that you have everything you need to submit.
