title: Getting Organized and Oriented
---

ALL students should read the [File Management guidelines](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/getting-organized-and-oriented/file-management) and at least review the suggestions for [making new maps](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/getting-organized-and-oriented/arcgis-10-desktop-orientation/working-with-arcmap). If you are coming into this class with previous ArcGIS experience (Version 9 or 10) most of these subpages will be review. If you are new to ArcGIS you may need to spend a little more time going through some of these materials. 

These pages will help you get started as well as serve as a later reference for you:
