title: Accessing ArcToolbox
---

The ArcToolbox is a set of GIS tools that can do most all the things that ArcMap can do, plus some things ArcMap cannot do. ESRI refers to the tasks these tools do as [geoprocessing](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/What_is_geoprocessing/002s00000001000000/). We will do more with the ArcToolbox in [later labs](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs), in particular when we talk more about geoprocessing. For now, we need to know how to access the toolbox. 

ArcToolbox can be started from within [ArcMap](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/getting-organized-and-oriented/arcgis-10-desktop-orientation/working-with-arcmap) or [ArcCatalog](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/lab01/getting-organized-and-oriented/arcgis-10-desktop-orientation/working-with-arccatalog). Unlike in ArcGIS 9.X versions, ArcToolbox can not be started independently as a stand-alone.  If you start ArcToolbox from within ArcMap, whatever processes you run using the toolbox will update automatically in the map. 
To start ArcToolbox, click on the ArcToolbox button ![img](http://gis.joewheaton.org/_/rsrc/1294535172518/assignments/labs/lab01/getting-organized-and-oriented/arcgis-10-desktop-orientation/working-with-arctoolbox/ArcToolboxButton.PNG). Your should read a [quick tour of geoprocessing](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/A_quick_tour_of_geoprocessing/002s00000002000000/) for an overview of using tools and toolboxes.

We wonâ€™t cover these tools now, except to say that it forms an important component of ArcGIS. This floating window may be docked into ArcMap for easy access.
