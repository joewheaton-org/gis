Welcome to the *Geographic Information Systems* course website. This site acts as the course page for WATS 4930, 4931, 6920, 6921 and 6900 (see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/about)for description of different courses; or [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/how-to-register) for how to enroll).

#### Enrolled & Past Students:

This website is the primary distribution point of information for the above-mentioned courses. We will use [Canvas](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/446138) for submitting [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) and tracking your grades, but this open-access site will be our main hub of all other information. As such, you will have a resource you can return to after you are done with the course.
