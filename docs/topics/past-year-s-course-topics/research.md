title: Research Topics & Guest Lectures
---

### Background

#### Introduction to Topic

 During these lecture slots, we will both discuss your projects and hear about specific research utilizing GIS and spatial analyses undertaken by a variety of researchers. 

#### Why we're Covering it

There are a plethora of ways in which GIS is used in research to address a diverse array of questions and issues. In these lectures, we will bring in some guest lecturers to share some of the clever ways in which they are using GIS for their research. As these will coincide with your own work on your projects, the intention i to give you ideas and inspirations about how you might be able to improve your own projects, extend them in the future, or simply have ideas and/or an awareness about what can be done with GIS. 

#### Learning Outcomes

These guest lectures help fulfill [primary learning outcomes](http://gis.joewheaton.org/about/primary-learning-outcomes) 1 & 4.
