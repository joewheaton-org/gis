title: Course Topics
---

These courses are organized into a series of [topics]({{ site.baseurl }}/about), which we will cover in the order listed below.  For each topic, you will find downloads of lecture materials, links to  [reading assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/reading-assignments-2010), links to [lab assignments and materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/labs), and additional information. Please note, that:

- topic pages may not be fully populated until we get to that topic in lecture; some lecture topics will appear populated with lectures and content from the previous year's lecture.
- topic pages may be updated even after we've covered a topic as typos and inconsistencies are brought to our attention or as we find new material that may help you better understand a topic
- if you find any problems or something that is confusing, please post a comment or question to the [appropriate topic forum](http://forum.bluezone.usu.edu/gis).
