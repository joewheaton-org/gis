[Joseph Flower](https://sites.google.com/site/josephpflower/lab/lab-01---arcgis-webgis-intro) did an excellent job for lab 1! His map has a good descriptive title, legend, North arrow, inset map, and scale. This map and follows in accordance with the 6 C's.  You can see that he has spent time to pay attention to detail and that this product is balanced and visually appealing.  To me the only things that could be modified is the size of the locator map (maybe make it a little smaller) and in the legend add the point that is displayed on the locator map to explain what it is.  Overall it is a Great Map!
