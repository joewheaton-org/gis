There were a lot of great maps for this lab! Keep up the good work.

[Nicole Cappuccio](https://sites.google.com/site/ncappucciogis2013/lab/lab-06-working-with-dems) had a great way of displaying and describing the difference between resolutions.  She was able to put quite a bit of information on a single map.  She had a short, yet descriptive paragraph, which made it easy to understand the difference between the DEM's resolution.  Being able to describe what resolution is and the difference between them is important.  Remember it is very important to know what resolution to use for a given project, knowing this can and will save you (and the computer) from a headache.

[Anthony Frenzel](https://sites.google.com/site/frenzelgis/labs/lab-6-working-with-dems) had a unique way to display the difference between the contour lines and the variation between them. Using this symbology (and a good looking legend) makes it easy to see that there is only a  little difference between the 2 meter and 5 meter datasets.  Looking at the base map underneath you can see that it is close to the 10 meter data set which shows that this may be the best dataset for this particular topographic base map.
