[Mitchell Dabling](https://sites.google.com/site/mitchelldabling/home/lab7) had an excellent submission for lab 7! When comparing the DEM's he made it clear what resolution each image is.  I know that no description was required for the map but it would have been helpful to explain to those who have no understanding of DEMs.  Even without a descriptive paragraph, by simply looking at the inset images a map reader can see which resolution is the most course.

While the DoD analysis is very important, I really like the fact that Mitchell points out in his write up "The model creation and batch processing tools were likely the most useful part of this exercise".  This is an often overlooked tool that is extremely useful when using ArcGIS.  Great job Mitchell!
