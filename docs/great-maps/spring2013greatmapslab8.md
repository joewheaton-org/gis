[Justin Britton](https://sites.google.com/site/jbgiscourse/lab/lab-8---morphometric-analysis) 

 did an excellent job on this project you can see that his DEM analysis skills have advanced and his ability to think critically and scientifically have really began to shine.  Not only was his watershed appropriately delineated but his morphometric analyses accurately displays the physical characteristics of the watershed.    

His Strahler stream order classification was compared to the GIS Portal data (which is trusted stream data) to ensure that his derived data was accurate relative to the GIS Portal data.

Justin was able to identify the landscape characteristics of the watershed and accurately asses the morphometric analysis preformed by properly using the Zonal Statistics tool.  Using the slope analysis he was able to identify the steepness of the terrain,  using the curvature tools he was able to display the divergence and convergence of landscape features.   His morphometric analysis is rather exceptional and thorough, excellent job on this lab Justin!
