[Nicole Cappuccio](https://sites.google.com/site/ncappucciogis2013/lab/lab-04-digitizing-editing-and-sharing-data) created a simple, yet easy to read map. Her table of campground sites and description of files were also very well done; professional, clear and easy to understand.  Great job Nicole!

Anthony Frenzel Also was very creative in the way he setup his map and legend.  His inset maps look good and give a good idea of where this campsite is going to be located.  Anthony did an excellent job at fitting four data frames in this map without overwhelming the reader with information.
