Abigail Kidd did an great job on this lab! She not only understands the importance of georeferencing  but also was able to display and explain the data in a very detailed manner.  Abigail used the aerial imagery we obtained for the blimp lab she was able to give the image a spatial reference but understands that this is a subjective process.  Great work!
