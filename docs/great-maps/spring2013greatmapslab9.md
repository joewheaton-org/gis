[Dave Iles](https://sites.google.com/site/ilesgis/labs/lab-09) did an excellent job for this lab!  He utilized the three raster datasets to accurately analyze the percent of the slope, vegetation type, and  distance to water. What we expected to see in this lab is a high correlation of the areas with high probability of ungulate activity to strongly reflect the three raster inputs.   His results for ungulate probability is clustered in the areas you would expect; such as near the water, high concentrations of vegetation, and where the terrain is more gradual.  Dave effectively demonstrated  this in his final figure.

Great job Dave!
