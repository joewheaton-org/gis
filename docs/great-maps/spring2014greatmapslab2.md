[Barry Prettyman](https://sites.google.com/site/barrypsgisclass/lab/lab-02-coordinate-data-projections-transformations) Did an excellent job on this lab.  His side by side comparison displays how these are spatially accurate points that are simply un-projected.  In laying these maps next to each other one can see the change from the un-projected assumed coordinate system points to the projected Cartesian coordinate system.  This map has a good layout, use of grids, clear title, and consistent symbology;  That is why it is the Great Map for Lap 2!
