This map has a good descriptive title, legend, North arrow, inset map, scale, and follows along with the 6 C's.  The things that stood out to me (besides the great map) was that the image being used as a base map is not referenced and the text scale bar should probably not be included since it may be inaccurate.  Make sure to reference ALL data sources.
