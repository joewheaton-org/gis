Students have been creating a lot of great maps, keep up the great work!

[Jarod Raithel](https://sites.google.com/site/jarodraithelgis/labs/lab-06)  created a truly exceptional map for this lab.  He was able to put  quite a bit of information on a single map.  He had a short, yet descriptive paragraph, which made it easy to understand the difference between the DEM's resolution.  Being able to describe different resolutions is important because many people are unaware of that file size is a direct reflection of pixel size.  Remember it is very important to know what resolution to use for a given project, knowing this can and will save you (and the computer) from a headache.

Jarod  your maps are informative and well structured, the side by side comparison are consistently displayed with clarity and professionalism. Great example of disappearing peak with pixel and contour maps.
