[Jarod Raithel](https://sites.google.com/site/jarodraithelgis/labs/lab-10) did an excellent job! He utilized all of the three  inputs slope, distance to water and vegetation cover very effectively .  He used great critical thinking skills in evaluating the model and it's process.  His work is thorough, which can be seen in his figures, captions, and maps. In looking at the framework he accurately calculated and interpreted the probability of ungulates across the landscape.  Great analysis Jarod!
