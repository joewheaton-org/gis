[Reid Camp](https://sites.google.com/site/reidcamp/wats-4930-labs/lab05) also had a very unique technique to creating a emergency evacuation map and gave a priority level to the land parcels.  He based his symbology by categorizing how much of the parcel that was within the river buffer, this is the scale he used:

Extreme: >75% within buffer
High: 50-75% within buffer
Moderate: 25-50% within buffer
Low: <25% within buffer
