Check out the animated GIF Seneca Francis made to compare the different DEM resolutions! It took me ages to figure out how to even get it on this site. Very impressive.

This is the contours derived by Rachel Curtis. By displaying the different contours with their respective DEM, I think you can see the differences much easier. It makes for a very effective map. Nice work!

Cia Wyshnytzky also had a great map for her contours, at a further zoomed out scale. You can see the processing artifact in the 30 m DEM very clearly. Nice map, Cia.
