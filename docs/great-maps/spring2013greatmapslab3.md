For this lab it was difficult to decide who had the best map because of the similarity between all of the maps. Although some people took extra time to think critically and then were able to display their critical thinking through their maps.  For instance [Adrian Roadman ](https://sites.google.com/site/aaroadman/lab-assignments/lab-three---reproducing-maps---geologic-map)   Did an excellent job with here map, but it is noteworthy to look at how she put an "Other" category on her pie chart  equal out to 100%.  This makes more sense than the 58.29% pie chart total asked for in the lab.  Good critical thinking goes a long way in GIS.

[Martha Jensen](https://sites.google.com/site/marthajensengis/lab/lab-03---reproducing-maps---geologic-map) also thought outside of the box by turning her map sideways.  This gave here more room to work with when it came time to add her title, north arrow, and most of all here legend.  When dealing with a legend of this size it is sometimes difficult to figure out a good cartographic way display a rather large legend. By simply turning her map side ways she took this sometimes difficult task and made it easy on herself.
