[Cody Edwards](https://sites.google.com/site/edwardsarcgis4930/lab-5-vector-analyses)  did an phenomenal job with his map, map workbook, and contact list!  The map is not only broken into 4 pages, but breaking the parcel data into 4 separate contact lists and color coordinating everything was exceptional. Cody went even further by organizing his contact list in accordance with the possible contamination zones.  In his write up inside of the map, he uses simple arithmetic to calculate his parcels on a parcel per zone basis (a percentage).  He did an excellent job and really paid attention to details.

[Peter Alexander](https://sites.google.com/site/peteralexandergis/labs/lab-05---vector-analyses) also had a respectable map and map workbook that are note worthy.  He used a road layer basemap with street names that emergency crews could use along side the contact list.  Displaying his map in this manner made his map appear very professional and detailed.  He did a great job in creating a truly effective map.  Everyone should really get a closer look at the labeled basemap by checking out his map workbook.
