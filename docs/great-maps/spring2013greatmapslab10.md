[Michel Kohl](https://sites.google.com/site/michelkohlswebspace/lab/lab-10--blimp-and-georeferencing) did an excellent job on this lab! Michel not only understands the importance of georeferencing  but also was able to display and explain the data being displayed.  Using the aerial image we obtained for the blimp lab Michel was able to give the image a spatial reference and was able to align the blimp image with an underlying master image. (See Below)

For task 3 Michel used the control points to a T! Using the bing basemap you can see that the georeferenced image is correct and reading through the write up you can tell that Michel used some serious critical thinking for this data set.
