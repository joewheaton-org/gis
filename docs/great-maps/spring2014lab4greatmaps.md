[Lette Benson](https://sites.google.com/site/lettebenson/lab/lab-4-digitizing-editing-and-sharing) Has created a excellent map that has gone above and beyond what was asked in the lab.  This proposal map of potential campgrounds has an excellent  layout that is creative and professional.  She did a great job on displaying where the campground using three data frames.  This is a lot of information to display and she a great job of doing without making the map look to clustered.  The only thing that I would suggest is to get rid of one of the base map references.  Other than that this was a great map, good job on this lab Lette!
