[Kevin Turnblom](https://sites.google.com/site/kevinturnblomwats6920/lab/lab-03) did and excellent in taking this complex legend and making it fit well with the map.  He went above and beyond by creating an extra map with a more detailed legend and graph!  I really like the fact that his graphs symbology is consistent with the Rock Type layer files symbology. He had an overall convincing cartographic design to his maps, graph, and legends. Great Map Kevin!
