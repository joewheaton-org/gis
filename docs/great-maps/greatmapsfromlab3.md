It was hard to pick great maps from this lab, because whaddya know? they all look almost identical. 

A few of you took extra time to add little touches to your maps that gave them really polished looks. For instance, [Rachel Curtis](https://sites.google.com/site/chelsgispectacular/lab/lab-3---reproducing-maps---geologic-map) made sure the two reference grid labels didn't over lap by changing the spacing between the label and the tick mark. She also added the declination line on her north arrow.

Also, her pie chart looks really sharp. Notice how the symbology matches that of the units on the map, making comparisons a lot easier.

Also, [Noah Schmadel](https://sites.google.com/site/noahslabs/laboratory-assignments/Lab03) had a great looking map, with appropriate sizing of the location map, small scale bars, larger legend and vivid contrast for all the layers in his map.
