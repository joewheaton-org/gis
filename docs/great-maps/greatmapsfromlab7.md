I'm not done looking through lab 7, but I thought I'd get it started with this map from task 3.

This is task three from [Courtney Newlon's lab](https://sites.google.com/site/courtneysgiswebsite1/labs/lab-7---building-dems/task-3---detection-analysis). She had so many little details (the data frame grid, the modified legend, the zoomed in detail data-frames) that combined to make a really nice looking map. Super great job Courtney.
