Check out this great map from Lab 1, done by [Cheyenne Burnett.](https://sites.google.com/site/cheyburnett/lab/lab-01--arcgis-webgis-intro) She added strong context by giving the background of studying riparian vegetation to address water quality issues.

Here is another great map, done by [Brian Wing.](https://sites.google.com/site/brianwingsgissite/lab/lab-01--arcgis-webgis-intro) His map also has good context, and is clear and easy to read.

Here is another map, done by Steven Sims. His map is very easily read, due to it's large fonts/pictures and simplicity. It shows how a good map isn't always a map with excess detail.
