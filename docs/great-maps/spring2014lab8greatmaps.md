[Matt Combs](https://sites.google.com/site/coombsgis/gis-lab-projects/lab-08-morphometric-analyses) created very clear yet detailed maps and images for the Morphometric Analysis lab.  His watershed delineation was clear and correct.  The stream order network map worked out well in terms of using an effective color ramp for the stream orders and DEM basemap .   He also calculated and color coordinated  the stream orders in his map with his "Segment length by order" table.  The curvature comparison maps display a lot of information within a small area which can be difficult to do.   Matt showed an incredible ability to analyze the surfaces of this 10 Meter DEM and preformed the series of morphometric analyses to a T.  Great mapping Matt!
