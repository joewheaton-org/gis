title: Primary Learning Outcomes
---

1. Understand the fundamental theory of Geographic Information Science behind Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and in so doing build an awareness of what GIS can and cannot be used for
2. Become proficient in the use of GIS tools to conduct spatial analyses and build maps that are fit-for-purpose and effectively convey the information they are intended to
3. Build confidence in teaching your-self how to undertake new analyses (unfamiliar to you) using GIS, troubleshooting problems in GIS, and seeking help from the GIS community to solve your problems
4. Use GIS analyses to address applied problems and/or research questions
5. Become effective in building maps that can be shared with non-GIS users (e.g. PDF maps and interactive webGIS maps)

The above learning outcomes apply to the courses as follows:
