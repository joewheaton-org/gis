To register:

1. Login to Access [Banner](https://ssb.banner.usu.edu/zprod/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin)
2. Click Student
3. Registration
4. Add/Drop Courses

**NOTE:** The registrar enforces enrollment caps for the labs that don't correspond to how many people we can actually accommodate in the class. As such, some of you may encounter trouble registering for WATS 4930 or  WATS 6920, because there is no available lab. Please simply bring an [Add/Drop form](http://www.usu.edu/registrar/files/publications/publication/pub__6383211.pdf) with you to the first day of class and I will discuss options for signing you in and can sign you in at the end of class.
