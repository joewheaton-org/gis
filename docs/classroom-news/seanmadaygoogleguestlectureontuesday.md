Geospatial Adventures in The Cloud'. 

Abstract:

Google runs the worldâ€™s most accessed mapping platforms. Google Maps is used over 1 million hours each day, and Google Earth has been downloaded over 1 billion times. These consumer mapping technologies have changed the way that individuals and organizations are interacting with maps. This session will discuss how Google is using cloud computing to drive innovation in the field of geospatial visualization and analysis.

Sean is a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer who currently works for Google, bringing the geospatial visualization power of Google Earth to war fighters. Below is a lecture he gave before coming to Google Earth on
